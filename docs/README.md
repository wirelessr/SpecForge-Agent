## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The AutoGen Multi-Agent Framework is built around four core agents with autonomous execution enhancement:

### Core Agents
- **PlanAgent**: Requirements analysis and specification generation
- **DesignAgent**: Technical design and architecture planning  
- **TasksAgent**: Task decomposition and implementation planning
- **Enhanced ImplementAgent**: Autonomous task execution with intelligent capabilities

### Autonomous Execution Components
- **TaskDecomposer**: Intelligent task breakdown into executable shell command sequences
- **ErrorRecovery**: Multi-strategy error recovery with learning capabilities
- **ContextManager**: Comprehensive project context integration
- **Quality Measurement Framework**: Objective quality assessment and continuous improvement

## üéØ Key Features

### Autonomous Execution Enhancement
- **Intelligent Task Decomposition**: Automatically converts high-level tasks into sequential shell command interactions
- **Multi-Strategy Error Recovery**: Analyzes failures and tries different approaches automatically
- **Context-Aware Execution**: Uses comprehensive project context including requirements, design, and execution history
- **Quality-First Implementation**: Produces high-quality, maintainable code following project standards

### Quality-First Development
- **Objective Quality Metrics**: Functionality, maintainability, standards compliance, test coverage, documentation
- **Quality Gates**: Phase-based quality checkpoints with baseline tracking
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learning from successful patterns and error recovery strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, end-to-end, and quality measurement tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

### Standard Workflow
```
User Request ‚Üí Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Tasks ‚Üí Implementation
         ‚Üì           ‚Üì        ‚Üì
      Approval      Approval   Approval
      Checkpoint    Checkpoint Checkpoint
```

### Quality Assurance Process
1. **Unit Testing**: Fast, isolated component tests
2. **Integration Testing**: Real service integration verification
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflow validation
4. **Quality Measurement**: Objective quality assessment against baselines

## üìñ Quick Start Guide

### For New Developers
1. Read the [README.md](../README.md) for project overview
2. Follow the [Developer Guide](../autogen_framework/docs/developer-guide.md) for architecture understanding
3. Review [Autonomous Execution Development Guide](../.kiro/steering/autonomous-execution-development-guide.md) for enhanced features
4. Check [Testing Standards](../tests/TESTING_STANDARDS_SUMMARY.md) for testing approach

### For Contributors
1. Follow [User Requirements First](../.kiro/steering/user-requirements-first.md) principles
2. Use [Git Tools Usage](../.kiro/steering/git-tools-usage.md) guidelines
3. Implement [Testing Simple Guide](../.kiro/steering/testing-simple-guide.md) practices
