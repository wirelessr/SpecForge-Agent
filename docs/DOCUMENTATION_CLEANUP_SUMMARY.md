## üóëÔ∏è Files Removed

### Obsolete Documentation
- **CONTEXT_MANAGER_INTEGRATION_PROPOSAL.md** - ‚úÖ Removed (feature implemented)
- **autogen_framework/docs/MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_RECORD.md** - ‚úÖ Removed (outdated)
- **autogen_framework/docs/MERGE_RESOLUTION_REPORT.md** - ‚úÖ Removed (outdated)
- **tests/README_CONTEXT_MANAGER_TESTS.md** - ‚úÖ Removed (superseded by standardized testing docs)

### Rationale for Removals
1. **CONTEXT_MANAGER_INTEGRATION_PROPOSAL.md**: The ContextManager integration has been fully implemented and is now documented in the architecture guides
2. **Merge conflict records**: These were temporary development artifacts no longer needed
3. **Component-specific test documentation**: Replaced by comprehensive, standardized testing documentation
