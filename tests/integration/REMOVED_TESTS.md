# Removed Integration Tests Documentation

This document records the integration tests that were removed during the LLM-focused redesign and the rationale for their removal.

## Overview

As part of the integration test suite redesign (Task 12), we removed redundant integration tests that duplicated unit test functionality without providing LLM validation. The goal was to focus integration tests specifically on LLM interactions and output quality validation.

## Removal Criteria

Tests were removed if they met one or more of these criteria:

1. **Mock All Dependencies**: Tests that mock all external dependencies without testing real LLM interactions
2. **Initialization Only**: Tests that only validate component initialization without testing functionality
3. **Duplicate Unit Coverage**: Tests that duplicate functionality already covered in unit tests
4. **No LLM Validation**: Tests that don't validate LLM output quality or intelligent operations

## Removed Test Files

### 1. `test_context_manager_integration.py`

**Removal Rationale:**
- **Primary Issue**: Mocks all LLM dependencies (uses `test_llm_config` instead of real LLM)
- **Functionality**: Only tests file loading, parsing, and data structure operations
- **Coverage**: All functionality is already covered in unit tests with proper mocking
- **No LLM Value**: Doesn't test any LLM-based context compression or intelligent context preparation

**Key Tests Removed:**
- `test_full_initialization_with_real_dependencies` - Only tests file parsing
- `test_plan_context_with_real_memory` - No LLM interaction, just data retrieval
- `test_design_context_with_requirements` - File loading without LLM processing
- `test_implementation_context_comprehensive` - Data structure validation only
- `test_execution_history_integration` - File I/O operations only

**Replacement Coverage:**
- Unit tests in `test_context_manager.py` cover all data operations with proper mocking
- LLM-specific context operations are covered in `test_llm_context_compressor.py`
- Real context management is tested in `test_llm_memory_integration.py`

### 2. `test_real_agent_manager.py`

## Verification Checklist

- [x] All removed test functionality is covered in unit tests
