### Adding New LLM Integration Tests

#### Pre-Development Checklist
- [ ] Identify the specific LLM behavior to be tested
- [ ] Determine the appropriate test category (Document Generation, Intelligent Operations, Context Management)
- [ ] Define quality criteria and thresholds for the test
- [ ] Plan test scenarios and expected outcomes

#### Development Process
1. **Create test file** following naming convention: `test_llm_{component}_{capability}.py`
2. **Extend base class**: Inherit from `LLMIntegrationTestBase`
3. **Implement test class** following naming pattern: `Test{Component}LLMIntegration`
4. **Add test methods** following naming pattern: `test_{llm_behavior}_{validation_aspect}()`
5. **Include quality validation** using `LLMQualityValidator`
6. **Add sequential execution** using `@sequential_test_execution()` decorator
7. **Document LLM behaviors** in comprehensive docstrings

#### Example Template
```python
"""
{Component} LLM Integration Tests.

This module tests the {Component}'s LLM interactions and output quality validation,
focusing on real LLM calls and {specific capability} quality assessment.

Test Categories:
1. {Behavior 1} with {validation aspect}
2. {Behavior 2} with {validation aspect}
3. {Behavior 3} with {validation aspect}

All tests use real LLM configurations and validate output quality using the
enhanced QualityMetricsFramework with LLM-specific validation methods.
"""

import pytest
from tests.integration.test_llm_base import LLMIntegrationTestBase, sequential_test_execution

class Test{Component}LLMIntegration(LLMIntegrationTestBase):
    """
    Integration tests for {Component} LLM interactions.
    
    These tests validate the {Component}'s ability to:
    - {Capability 1} using real LLM calls
    - {Capability 2} with quality validation
    - {Capability 3} with improvement assessment
    """
    
    @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
    def setup_{component}_agent(self, real_llm_config, initialized_real_managers, temp_workspace):
        """Setup {Component} with real LLM configuration and managers."""
        # Setup implementation
    
    @sequential_test_execution()
    async def test_{llm_behavior}_{validation_aspect}(self):
        """
        Test {LLM behavior} with {validation aspect}.
        
        This test validates that the {Component} can {specific behavior}
        using real LLM calls and meets quality thresholds.
        """
        # Test implementation
```

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Rate Limiting Issues
**Symptoms**: 429 errors, "rate limit exceeded" messages
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check if `@sequential_test_execution()` decorator is applied
2. Verify rate limit handler is functioning correctly
3. Review test execution logs for timing patterns
4. Check LLM service rate limit configuration

**Solutions**:
- Ensure all LLM tests use sequential execution
- Increase delay between test executions if needed
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit recovery
- Contact LLM service provider if limits are too restrictive

#### Quality Threshold Failures
**Symptoms**: Tests failing on quality assessments consistently
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Review recent quality score trends
2. Check if LLM model or configuration changed
3. Validate quality assessment criteria
4. Compare against historical baselines

**Solutions**:
- Adjust quality thresholds if model performance changed
- Improve prompts if quality degraded
- Update quality assessment criteria if requirements changed
- Investigate and fix any quality framework issues

#### Test Execution Performance Issues
**Symptoms**: Tests taking significantly longer to execute
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Profile test execution to identify bottlenecks
2. Check LLM service response times
3. Review test complexity and scope
4. Analyze resource usage patterns

**Solutions**:
- Optimize test implementation for efficiency
- Reduce test scope if overly comprehensive
- Implement caching for repeated operations
- Consider parallel execution for non-LLM components

#### Context Integration Issues
**Symptoms**: Tests failing on context-dependent operations
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Verify context manager setup and initialization
2. Check memory integration and data flow
3. Validate context data quality and completeness
4. Review context compression and formatting

**Solutions**:
- Ensure proper context manager initialization
- Fix memory integration issues
- Improve context data quality
- Optimize context compression settings

### Escalation Procedures

#### Issue Severity Levels
- **Critical**: Tests completely failing, blocking development
- **High**: Significant quality degradation or reliability issues
- **Medium**: Performance issues or minor quality problems
- **Low**: Documentation updates or minor improvements

#### Escalation Process
1. **Document issue** with symptoms, investigation results, and impact
2. **Attempt standard solutions** based on troubleshooting procedures
3. **Escalate to team lead** if standard solutions don't resolve issue
4. **Involve framework architects** for critical or complex issues
5. **Update procedures** based on resolution to prevent recurrence
