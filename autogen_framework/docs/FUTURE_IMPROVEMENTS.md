# Future Improvements and Roadmap

This document tracks the next major improvement planned for the AutoGen Multi-Agent Framework with Autonomous Execution Enhancement.

## üéØ Next Major Enhancement

### Context and Token Management Optimization

**Priority: HIGH**  
**Status: Proposal Phase**  
**Expected Impact: High Performance and Cost Improvement**

The framework's context and token management systems represent the next major optimization opportunity. Current challenges include context inefficiency, performance bottlenecks, and token waste that directly impact user experience and operational costs.

#### Key Improvements Planned
1. **Intelligent Context Prioritization**: Dynamic ranking of context elements by task relevance
2. **Advanced Caching System**: Smart caching with automatic invalidation for frequently accessed context
3. **Adaptive Token Budgeting**: Dynamic token allocation based on task complexity and agent needs
4. **Semantic Compression**: Preserve meaning while reducing token count through semantic analysis
5. **Incremental Updates**: Update context incrementally rather than full rebuilds

#### Expected Benefits
- **Performance**: 60-80% reduction in context processing time
- **Cost**: 30-40% reduction in token usage and API costs
- **User Experience**: 2-3x faster agent responses
- **Scalability**: Support for larger projects without performance degradation

#### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (4 weeks)**: Foundation components - ContextPrioritizer, ContextCache, TokenBudgetManager
- **Phase 2 (6 weeks)**: Advanced features - SemanticCompressor, IncrementalContextManager
- **Phase 3 (4 weeks)**: Optimization and fine-tuning based on real-world usage
