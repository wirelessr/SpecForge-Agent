# Future Improvements and Known Issues

This document tracks important improvements and fixes that need to be implemented in future versions of the AutoGen Multi-Agent Framework.

## Current Priority Issues

### 1. Context Compression Strategy Refinement

**Priority: MEDIUM**  
**Status: Partially Implemented**

The current context compression strategy in BaseLLMAgent works well but could be enhanced for optimal workflow context preservation.

#### Areas for Improvement

1. **Workflow-Aware Compression**: Compression should understand workflow phases and preserve phase-specific critical information
2. **Progressive Compression**: Implement multi-level compression strategies based on context age and relevance
3. **Context Reconstruction**: Ability to reconstruct compressed context when needed for detailed analysis
4. **Agent-Specific Compression**: Different compression strategies for TasksAgent vs ImplementAgent based on their specific needs

## Low Priority Enhancements

### 2. Cross-Phase Context Analytics

**Priority: LOW**  
**Status: Not Started**

Implement analytics to track how context flows between workflow phases and identify optimization opportunities.

### 3. Context Validation Framework

**Priority: LOW**  
**Status: Not Started**

Develop automated validation to ensure critical context is preserved across workflow phases.

### 4. Advanced Workflow Orchestration

**Priority: LOW**  
**Status: Not Started**

Enhance WorkflowManager with advanced features like conditional workflows, parallel phase execution, and custom workflow definitions.

## Implementation Notes

- All changes should maintain backward compatibility with the new architecture
- Comprehensive testing required before deployment
- Consider token usage implications of expanded context
- Monitor performance impact of context expansion
- Document context flow patterns for future optimization
- Leverage the new modular architecture for easier feature implementation
