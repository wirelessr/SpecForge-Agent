A sophisticated multi-agent collaboration framework built on AutoGen that automates the complete software development lifecycle from requirements analysis to code implementation.

For a comprehensive guide on features, architecture, and advanced usage, please see the **[Framework Documentation](autogen_framework/README.md)**.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- uv (Python package manager)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
# cd into the repository directory you just cloned

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LLM configuration
```

### Basic Usage

For detailed instructions and examples, refer to the **[Framework Documentation](autogen_framework/README.md)**.

```bash
# Create a workspace directory
mkdir my-project && cd my-project

# Submit a development request
autogen-framework --workspace . --request "Create a REST API for user management"

# Review and approve each phase
autogen-framework --workspace . --status
autogen-framework --workspace . --approve requirements
# ... and so on for design and tasks

# Execute implementation
autogen-framework --workspace . --execute-tasks
```

## üéØ Development Principles

This framework is built on three core principles:

1.  **User Requirements First**: The system should faithfully implement user requirements without adding unsolicited features.
2.  **Quality-First Development**: We are committed to high-quality code through comprehensive testing, quality metrics, and continuous improvement.
3.  **Autonomous Execution**: Agents should execute tasks intelligently, with robust error recovery and learning capabilities.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Before you start, please review our **[Developer Guide](autogen_framework/docs/developer-guide.md)** and **[Testing Overview](tests/README.md)**.

### Development Setup
