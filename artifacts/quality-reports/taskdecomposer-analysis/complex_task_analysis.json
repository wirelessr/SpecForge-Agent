Implement basic arithmetic functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide\n3. Add proper error handling for division by zero\n4. Include docstrings for all functions\n5. Create a simple CLI interface that accepts two numbers and an operation\n6. Add input validation to ensure numbers are valid\n7. Create a test file 'test_calculator.py' with unit tests\n8. Make the module executable with 'python calculator.py'"

    "\"Strategy 4: If creating a comprehensive CLI interface using 'argparse' is challenging, use a simpler approach with 'sys.argv' to directly access commandline arguments. This will require manual parsing and validation but is less complex to set up initially.\",",
    "\"Strategy 5: If unit tests in 'test_calculator.py' fail, start by writing simpler, more focused tests that target individual functions with specific inputs. Gradually add more complex tests as the basic tests pass.\",",
    "\"Strategy 6: If making 'calculator.py' executable directly using '#!/usr/bin/env python3' fails, explicitly run the script using 'python calculator.py <arguments>' instead of './calculator.py <arguments>'.\",",
    "\"Strategy 7: If the ZeroDivisionError is not being caught correctly, use a more general 'try...except Exception as e:' block to catch any exceptions during division and print a generic error message.  Then, refine the exception handling to specifically target ZeroDivisionError.\",",
    "\"Strategy 8: If the tests are failing due to subtle differences in floatingpoint arithmetic, use 'assertAlmostEqual' in the unit tests instead of 'assertEqual' to account for small variations.\",",
    "\"Strategy 9: If the task is too complex to finish in one sitting, break the task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, such as implementing only addition first, then subtraction, and so on. Test each subtask thoroughly before moving on.\""
